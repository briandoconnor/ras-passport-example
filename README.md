# Repackaging NIH RAS GA4GH Passport into a Broad GA4GH Passport

This is a prototype to show how a client could repackage an NIH RAS passport into a Broad signed passport. Both the passport and the visas are encoded.

To run this you'll need:
1. Broad client_secret for getting the access token from RAS
2. RSA private key for encoding Broad passports
